Test set 1
----------
This task was pretty difficult. Initially I was trying to find some set of specific rules I would use to generate squares. Turned out that it was not possible even for a square of size 5 or less. So instead I was searching for diagonal that has given trace and then try to generate row by row by brute forcing. Worked well for smaller squares.

Test set 2
----------
For obvious reasons this approach was not working at all for bigger squares.
