Parenting Partnering Returns
============================
I implemented greedy allocation that first tries to assign job that takes longest time to complete. If Cameron has no job assigned that would conflict, they are assigned the task. If not it is assigned to Jamie.
This didn't work well and was not able to solve even the first test set.
